# HelpMeTest MCP Server - Real AI Integration Examples

This document shows how an AI assistant would actually use the HelpMeTest MCP server
to answer user questions. The AI analyzes natural language prompts, chooses appropriate
tools, and formats responses naturally.

**Generated on:** 2025-06-21T12:37:37.018Z

## How This Works

1. **User asks a natural question** (e.g., "How is my server doing?")
2. **AI analyzes the prompt** and decides which MCP tool to use
3. **MCP server processes the request** and returns data
4. **AI formats a natural response** for the user

<!-- ## User: "How is my server doing?"
